To do this, we will evaluate different k values using the average [silhouette score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)), similarly to the PCA analysis previously conducted, and ultimately select **k = 13**. Note that these evaluations are imperfect tools used  to inform our decisions; the results from them change with underlying representations, parametric choices, random initializations, metrics used, and other factors.

    "## Categories \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned before, all the queries in the dataset are read-only. This might have implications for various query optimizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we briefly describe the 13 query categories within the context of the Spider SQL corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### SELECTION queries\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that return (select) a subset of records from a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - All the queries in the query corpus are `SELECT` queries, as there are no \"action\" (delete, update, create, index, etc.) queries. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - However, there are only a few simple  `SELECT` queries (e.g., `SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table`) that do not involve other SQL constructs beyond `FROM`. These simple queries are much less frequent, with only around 194 of them.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - All the simple cases are clustered in Cluster 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### FILTERING queries\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries that select records based on their match with criteria expressed in `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, involving, e.g., predicates \n",
    "    and operators such as `BETWEEN` and `IN`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - FILTERING queries are the most common (~3875) queries in our corpus, comprising more than the half.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - They are concentrated in Clusters 6, 0, and 2 in the above visualizations.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "* ### AGGREGATION queries\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that calculate summary scalar values such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN` over selections (we consider `COUNT` queries separately).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - AGGREGATION queries are very common (~1112). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - They are typical data analytics queries and often repeated over identical tables and columns, making them ideal candidates for optimizations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In the above visualizations, AGGREGATION queries are distributed over clusters, while mostly concentrated in Clusters 0, 6, and 9.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* ### COUNTING queries \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries that calculate the count of records over matching selections. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `COUNT` queries  are the third most common category in our corpus with around 2705 instances. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - These queries, similar to other aggregation queries, are spread throughout all clusters, but are more concentrated in Clusters 2, 10, and 1. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Optimizations based on data sketching can improve the performance of these queries.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "* ### GROUPING queries\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries that group data based on  column values using `GROUP BY` clause. `GROUP BY` is often used before aggregation operations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In the dataset, `WHERE` clauses come before `GROUP BY`,  while `HAVING` clauses come after, which is in line in common practices. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - GROUPING queries are the fourth most frequent (~1775) queries in the corpus and often used together with `COUNT`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - There are concentrated in Clusters 2, 12, 10, and 1. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* ### ORDERING queries\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that sort records by a specifict column using ORDER BY, frequently accompanied by `DESC` (`ORDER BY` sorts in ascending order by default)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In the corpus, ORDERING queries are common (~1628). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Clusters 1, 14, and 10 contain most of the ORDERING queries. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* ### TOP-k queries\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An important subclass of ORDERING queries in this dataset is TOP-k queries, where k is specified by `LIMIT` and is typically 1. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Most (~1107) of the ORDERING queries in the dataset are TOP-k queries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - TOP-k queries can be expensive, particularly when k = 1 (single point queries), which is the most frequent (~1001) case, and should be targeted for optimizations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Most of the TOP-k queries are in Clusters 1, 10, and 3 in the above visaulizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### `JOIN` queries\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries that combine (join) columns from multiple tables (e.g. _Show the name of all bridges that was designed by an American architect, and sort the result by the bridge feet length_ --> `SELECT t1.name FROM bridge AS t1 JOIN architect AS t2 ON t1.architect_id  =  t2.id WHERE t2.nationality  =  'American' ORDER BY t1.length_feet`)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - In the clustering visualizations above, `JOIN` queries are primarily represented in Clusters 6, 2, and 1.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - There is also a significant number (~827) of **multi-`JOIN`** queries. These queries typically represent complex operations that could benefit from optimizations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Clusters 6, 5, and 2 contain most of the multi-`JOIN` queries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* ### `INTERSECT` queries \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that intersect records from two select statements, using the `INTERSECT` clause. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - While more frequent than `UNION` queries, compared to `JOIN` queries, `INTERSECT` queries are less frequent (~250) in the query corpus. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Most of these queries are in Clusters 6, 0, and 8. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* ### `UNION` queries \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that combine (stack on top of each other) information from two select statements using the `UNION` clause. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Unlike JOIN queries, UNION queries are infrequent (~67) in the  corpus. They are the least frequent queries in the corpus. \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### `DISTINCT` queries\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries retrieves unique values from specified columns using DISTINCT.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `DISTINCT` queries occur occassionally (~721). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - They are primarily grouped in Clusters 6, 11, and 9. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* ### PATTERN MATCHING queries \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Queries that match character patterns in column values using the `LIKE` operator (e.g., _Find all the catalog publishers whose name contains \"Murray\"_ -->`SELECT distinct(catalog_publisher) FROM catalogs WHERE catalog_publisher LIKE \"%Murray%\"`) \n",
    "\n",
    "    - PATTERN MATCHING queries are infrequent (~171) in our corpus, being the second least frequent. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Nevertheless, these queries can be expensive and, hence, important for performance optimization. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Almost all the PATTERN MATCHING queries are concentrated in Clusters 0, 6, and 13. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* ### NESTED queries \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Queries involving one or more subqueries (e.g., _List the id of students who never attends courses_ -->`SELECT * FROM student_course_registrations WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM student_course_attendance`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The corpus has a modest size (~452) of NESTED queries. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Crucially, these queries are often complex queries and can be a source of performance bottlenecks.  \n",
    "    \n",
